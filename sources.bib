We consider scattering by an obstacle as well as scattering by an inhomogeneous medium both in ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0266-5611/19/6/057/ip162700ieqn1.gif] {\mathbb {R}^2} and ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0266-5611/19/6/057/ip162700ieqn2.gif] {\mathbb {R}^3} . Included in our discussion is the use of regularization methods for ill-posed problems and numerical examples in both two and three dimensions.}

  abstract={The linear sampling method is a method to reconstruct the shape of an obstacle in time-harmonic inverse scattering without a priori knowledge of either the physical properties or the number of disconnected components of the scatterer. Although it has been proven numerically to be a fast and reliable method in many situations, no mathematical argument has yet been found to prove why this is so. Using results obtained by Kirsch in deriving the related factorization method , we show in this paper that for a large class of scattering problems, linear sampling can be interpreted rigorously as a numerical method to reconstruct the shape of an obstacle; or in other words that linear sampling must work for problems in this class.}

By a cavity we understand any object with a different electrical conductivity from the background material of the body. We survey two algorithms for solving this inverse problem, namely the factorization method and a MUSIC-type algorithm. In particular, we present a number of numerical results to highlight the potential and the limitations of these two methods.}

An application is given to the problem of determining the shape of an object buried in the earth from measurements on the surface of the earth. The advantages of the method are that (1) no a priori knowledge is needed of the physical properties of the scattering object and (2) there is no need to compute Green's function for the background medium.}

We derive a factorization of the far field operator F in the form ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0266-5611/14/6/009/img1.gif] and prove that the ranges of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0266-5611/14/6/009/img2.gif] and G coincide. Then we give an explicit characterization of the scattering obstacle which uses only the spectral data of the far field operator F . This result is used to prove a convergence result for a recent numerical method proposed by Colton, Kirsch, Monk, Piana and Potthast. We illustrate this method by some numerical examples.}
